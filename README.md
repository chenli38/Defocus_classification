# Deep learning-based autofocus method enhances image quality in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy
a deep learning-based autofocus framework that can estimate the position of the objective-lens focal plane relative to the light-sheet, based on two defocused images.

**train_model.py**: 
 - loading dataset, network model and hyperparameters setting, training

**test_all.py**:
 - comparing network train and test losses under different configurations from loss(train_model.py) for example, numbers of input images, different zspacing
 - input: .txt, .pt(model)
 - output: graphs

**pred_img_6nm.py**
 - analysis defocus infomation of single image (large 5128*512) or image patch (small 64*64)
 - input: image (large or small), model
 - output: network prediction and certainty value
